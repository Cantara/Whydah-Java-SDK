Whydah-Java-SDK
===============

A client library which aimed to make Whydah integration more easy and more resilient

![Build Status](http://jenkins.capraconsulting.no/buildStatus/icon?job=Whydah-Java-SDK)

* XML and JSON parsing of Whydah datastructures sent over the wire.
* Client logic for using Whydah Web SSO - SSOLoginWebapp (SSOLWA).
* Client logic for using and controlling Whydah sessions - SecurityTokenService (STS).
**	The Java SDK is in a really early stage, and is currently used to experiment with a new remoting approach to increase system resilliance

## Example code

```java
        URI tokenServiceUri = UriBuilder.fromUri("https://whydahdev.altrancloud.com/tokenservice/").build();
        ApplicationCredential appCredential = new ApplicationCredential("applicationID","applicationSecret");
        String myAppTokenXml = new CommandLogonApplication(tokenServiceUri, appCredential).execute();
        String myApplicationTokenID = ApplicationXpathHelper.getAppTokenIdFromAppToken(myAppTokenXml);
        UserCredential userCredential = new UserCredential("username", "password");
        String userToken = new CommandLogonUserByUserCredential(tokenServiceUri, myApplicationTokenID, myAppTokenXml, userCredential, UUID.randomUUID().toString()).execute();
        //
        // Or simply
        //
        String userToken =WhydahUtil.logOnApplicationAndUser("https://whydahdev.altrancloud.com/tokenservice/", "applicationID","applicationSecret", "username", "password");

```
